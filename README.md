DHEX is a company for packaging, transportation and delivery of shippings at national level
(Continental US for now).

Most of the company operations are made manually, it needs to automate their core processes.
This is the primary goal in the short-term.

It has the internationalization as the second short-term goal.
Some countries on their target for this are: Brazil, Peru and Colombia.

This product, *DHEX Shipping*, is the first effort on the digitalization goals of the company.
